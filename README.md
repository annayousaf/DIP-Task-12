Task 12
Write a complete Python script for Google Colab that performs thresholding and segmentation on an uploaded image. The script should allow the user to interactively upload an image, convert it to grayscale, and apply global thresholding, Otsu’s thresholding, and adaptive thresholding to create binary images. It should also perform color-based segmentation using K-Means clustering with different numbers of clusters (e.g., k=2, 3, 4) and mean shift filtering for smoothing and segmentation. Finally, the script should display all results — including the original image, thresholded images, K-Means segmented images, and mean-shift segmented image — in a single figure with multiple subplots using matplotlib, showing grayscale images in gray and color images in RGB.
